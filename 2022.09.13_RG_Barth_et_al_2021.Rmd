# Context of the paper

## Family Problems picture task, [@san12]

This tasks was developed for a research of the grammaticized expression of **social cognition**, that combines

- “social facts” such as kinship relationships;
- “psychological facts” (such as feelings, desires, or attentional states);
- and something else. \pause

Authors wanted to create a task that stimulates production

- of different speech types (descriptions, dialogic interactions, narrative);
- of linguistic expressions relevant to the domain of social cognition;
- of parallel spontaneous texts (in the broad sense) across languages.

## Family Problems picture task, [@san12: 144--145]

"Two participants (A and B) sit together, either side-by-side or oriented slightly toward each other, with an open flat space (e.g., the ground, a table) in front of
them. The activity involves three components:

> (i) the participants are given the pictures one at a time and describe the content of each;
> (ii) the participants are asked to arrange the pictures as an ordered narrative, working together;
> (iii) participants are asked to tell the story from start to finish, from both third-
person and first-person perspectives, typically to an audience that had not
seen the pictures or heard the story before."

## The Social Cognition Parallax Interview Corpus (SCOPIC)

This corpus was developed in [@barth17] and produced 

- [corpus](https://scopicproject.wordpress.com/)
- [@barth21] (we are currently reading);
- and a lot of papers in journal of *Asian and African Languages and Linguistics* dedicated to specific languages of the corpus.

**Parallax corpus** -- comparable corpus 

By ‘parallax corpus’ we mean ‘broadly comparable formulations resulting from a comparable task’, to avoid the implications of ‘parallel corpus’ that there will be exact semantic equivalence across languages.
