# Context of the paper

## Family Problems picture task, [@san12]

This task was developed for a research of the grammaticized expression of **\underline{social cognition}**, that combines

- “social facts” such as kinship relationships;
- “psychological facts” (such as feelings, desires, or attentional states);
- and something else. \pause

Authors wanted to create a task that stimulates production

- of different speech types (descriptions, dialogic interactions, narratives);
- of linguistic expressions relevant to the domain of social cognition;
- of some known interesting grammatical categories (e.g. evidentiality);
- of parallel but spontaneous texts (in the broad sense) across different languages.

## Family Problems picture task, [@san12]

"Two participants (A and B) sit together, either side-by-side or oriented slightly toward each other, with an open flat space (e.g., the ground, a table) in front of
them. The activity involves three components:

(i) the participants are given the pictures one at a time and describe the content of each;
(ii) the participants are asked to arrange the pictures as an ordered narrative, working together;
(iii) participants are asked to tell the story from start to finish, from both third-
person and first-person perspectives, typically to an audience that had not
seen the pictures or heard the story before." [@san12: 144--145]

## The Social Cognition Parallax\footnote[frame]{By ‘parallax corpus’ we mean ‘broadly comparable formulations resulting from a comparable task’, to avoid the implications of ‘parallel corpus’ that there will be exact semantic equivalence across languages. (Barth and Evans 2017: 1)} Interview Corpus (SCOPIC)

There are just seven languages in [@san12]. The main drivers of this project (D. Barth and N. Evans) got funding, and as a result in [@barth17] they claimed to have 24 (and over 30 languages now).

- [\alert{corpus website}](https://scopicproject.wordpress.com/);
- recordings and some annotations are available in [\alert{PARADISEC catalog}](http://catalog.paradisec.org.au/collections/SocCog);
- 31 publications including [@barth21].

# Goal of the paper

## Goal of the paper

The authors make it clear on the second page of the paper:

- "Can we measure the relative contributions of language structures and individual variation to how people formulate statements about the world?
- Do accounts of typological differences need to take individual variation into account, and is such variation more prevalent in some kinds of linguistic domains than others?" [@barth21: 181] \pause
